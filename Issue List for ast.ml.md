#Issue List

##Critical

* Need to find **DIFFERENT** ways to reference *Array*, *Table*, *Record* and *Field*. The parser will not be able to distinguish them under current reference manual.

* How to automatically recognize the data type stored in the Table, Record and Field, this procedure is quite hard in the target code generation.
